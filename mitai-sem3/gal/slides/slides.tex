\begin{frame}\frametitle{Formal Problem Definition}

Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the radiocoloring of $G$ is a mapping $f: V \rightarrow N$, such that $\forall v,u \in V: |f(u) - f(v)| \geq k + 1 - d(u,v)$, where $d(u,v)$ is a distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Largest-degree first
   \item Algorithm
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Sort the vertices in descending order by their degree.
      \item Compute distance 2 binary matrix.
      \item Initialize a $n$ x $2n - 1$ binary matrix \emph{''forbidden``} ($O(n^2)$).
      \item Find the smallest non-conflicting color, assign it and update forbidden matrix.
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

$$\textrm{DTIME} \approx O(n^2) + O(n \log n) + O(n^3) + O(n^3) \approx O(n^3)$$

$$\textrm{DTIME}_n \approx O(n) + O(\log n) + O(n^2) + O(n \log n) \approx O(n^2)$$
